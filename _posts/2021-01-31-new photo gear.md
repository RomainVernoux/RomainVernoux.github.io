After 8 years with my *Nikon D5100* reflex, I thought it was time to upgrade.
I am still deeply convinced that, in most conditions, a mid-level reflex camera is more than enough to get the perfect shot.
After all, composition, exposure and depth of field are a matter of technique and have almost nothing to do with the camera.

But after 23077 shutter clicks, I wanted to go full-frame and have the right tool for any condition: low light, rain, long exposure, high ISO...

I will keep great memories of my *D5100*, exploring [Paris at night](https://www.flickr.com/photos/romainvernoux/16310573419/in/album-72157632783229475/),
shooting [models in a closed theater](https://www.flickr.com/photos/romainvernoux/16827071662/in/album-72157632621508452/),
capturing the [Milky Way at the top of a remote Corsica mountain](https://www.flickr.com/photos/romainvernoux/31573520310/in/album-72157674655152313/) with a friend...
And soaking my telephoto lens (the Vibration Reduction module has never been the same!) during a [solo trek in Iceland](https://www.flickr.com/photos/romainvernoux/14939684353/in/album-72157647072634750/)!
Don't worry though, the *D5100* is still going strong and already started a new life with its new owner!

Considering my options for a while, and wanting to stick to Nikon, I figured that mirrorless was the future.
In fact Nikon officially announced its focus on mirrorless a few days later! With an attractive discount I finally 
settled on the *Nikon Z6II* with the *Nikon Z 24-70mm f/4 S*.

It will take some time to get fully accustomed to the beast, but the first feelings are great!
Definitely looking forward taking it to the field!

As a Nikon photographer, the menu and settings definitely feel like home.
For further reference, there exists a very interesting [official guide](https://download.nikonimglib.com/archive4/l8G7R00icqYZ04JR9UI73XASmf73/Z7IIZ6II_TG_Setting_(En)01.pdf) of recommended settings for still photography.
